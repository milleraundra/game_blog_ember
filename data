Le Havre is a Uwe Roseberg game that features a shipping and goods acquisition theme. This is a classic game amongst experienced players and hailed as one of the greatest games of all time.

When playing the game, the first thing we noticed was the extremely long setup process. However, once playing we immediately enjoyed the density of game mechanics and layout of components and buildings.
